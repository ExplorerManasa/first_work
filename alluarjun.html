	<p>Allu Arjun was born on 8 April 1982[a] in a Telugu family in Madras (present-day Chennai) to film producer Allu Aravind and Nirmala. His paternal grandfather was the noted film comedian Allu Ramalingaiah who appeared in over 1000 films.[14][15] Their native place is Palakollu of West Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh.[16] Allu Arjun grew up in Chennai before their family moved to Hyderabad in his 20s.[17][18]

He is the second of three children. His elder brother Venkatesh is a businessman while his younger brother Sirish is an actor. His paternal aunt is married to Chiranjeevi.[19] His cousins, namely, Ram Charan, Varun Tej, Sai Dharam Tej, and Niharika Konidela are also actors.[20]After playing as a child artist in Vijetha (1985) and as a dancer in Daddy (2001), he made his adult debut in Gangotri.[21] The film was directed by K. Raghavendra Rao with his father Allu Aravind producing, along with C. Ashwini Dutt.[22] Praising his acting performance, Jeevi of Idlebrain criticized his looks in the film and added that "Arjun should choose roles that amplify his strength and nullify his weaknesses."[23] He then appeared in Sukumar's Arya.[24] He plays "Arya", an outgoing and free-spirited boy falling in love with Geetha (Anu Mehta), an introverted girl who is on the shield of another person Ajay (Siva Balaji).[25] The film was his breakthrough, earning a first Filmfare Best Telugu Actor Award nomination and winning a Nandi Special Jury Award at the Nandi Awards of 2008 ceremony, two CineMAA Awards for Best Actor and Best Actor Jury.[26] The film was a critical and commercial success,[27] grossing over ₹30 crore,[28] with a production budget of ₹4 crore.[29] In 2006, the film was dubbed and released in Malayalam in Kerala. Owing to the film's success, he received wide acclaim across the region and the Malayali people.[30]

He next starred in V. V. Vinayak's Bunny playing "Bunny", a college student.[31] Being successful at the box office, critics praised his efforts, mannerisms and dancing.[32][33] His next film was A. Karunakaran's musical love story Happy.[34][35] The film had done well at the box-office especially in the overseas market.[36] A critic appreciated his dancing skills and performance, but felt that his character is a typical happy-go-lucky guy.[37</p>

<p>Arjun played the role of a college student in two films — Sukumar's directorial debut Arya, and V. V. Vinayak's Bunny. His role in the former was his breakthrough, earning him his first Nandi Special Jury Award. Arjun collaborated with A. Karunakaran on the film Happy, in which he played a villager completing his graduation in Hyderabad while working part-time as a pizza delivery boy.[3] The film was a commercial success with its dubbed version becoming an all time blockbuster in Kerala.[4] Arjun later collaborated with Puri Jagannadh on the film Desamuduru, in which he played the role of a crime reporter working for MAA TV.[5] For the role, Arjun sported a long hairdo and worked out to develop sculpted abdominal muscles.[6] Desamuduru received positive reviews from critics and became a commercial success, establishing him as an action hero.[7] He received his second Filmfare Best Telugu Actor Award nomination for the same, he won CineMAA Awards for Best Actor Jury.[8] In the same year he also made a cameo appearance in the film Shankar Dada Zindabad, directed by Prabhu Deva.[9]
